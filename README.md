##  Objective

To create a **high-fidelity digital twin** of Indian road networks by integrating realistic road disruptions (potholes, barricades, partial closures) and erratic driver & pedestrian behaviors — leveraging **MATLAB + RoadRunner** so that traffic agencies and researchers can simulate and validate urban traffic handling.

---

##  Features

- Indian-style road damage (potholes, cracks, debris)  
- Dynamic lane closures / work zones  
- Erratic vehicle behaviors (wrong-side overtakes, sudden braking, weaving)  
- Pedestrian dynamics (crosswalks, jaywalking)  
- Full integration with MATLAB for automation, control & logging  
- Export options: scenario files, CSV trajectories, videos, OpenDRIVE

##  Architecture



[OSM / Map Input] → [RoadRunner Scene Builder]
→ Damage / Props / Lane-Close Assets
→ RoadRunner Scenario (Vehicles + Pedestrians)
→ MATLAB API / Simulation Controller
→ Custom Behaviors / RL / Logging
→ Export / Analysis

##  Tech Stack & Tools

| Tool / Library | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| MATLAB + Simulink | Scripting, orchestration, co-simulation |
| RoadRunner | Scene & scenario creation / playback |
| Automated Driving Toolbox | Sensor emulation, scenario tools |
| Reinforcement Learning Toolbox | (Optional) train erratic behavior agents |
| OSM / GIS Tools | Import real-world city maps |

---

##  Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitdocify/HARSHSINGH3118/Indian_Road_Simulator.git
   cd Indian_Road_Simulator


Open MATLAB → add RoadRunner API path

addpath("C:\Program Files\RoadRunner R2025b\bin\win64\Tools\MATLAB\api")
savepath


Launch your project:

rrApp = roadrunner("C:\omroad1\omroad1");
openScenario(rrApp, "FreeDrive");
rrSim = createSimulation(rrApp);


Run simulation:

set(rrSim, "StopTime", 30);
start(rrSim);


(Optional) Loop indefinitely:

while true
    set(rrSim, "StopTime", 30);
    start(rrSim);
    pause(1);
end

 Demo & Exports
---
exports/simulation_demo.mp4 — video record of traffic with potholes + erratic drivers

exports/trajectories.csv — actor positions & velocities over time

exports/FreeDrive.rrscenario — the scenario file you can open in RoadRunner

exports/FreeDrive.rrscene — your base road + environment

 How To Use / Evaluate

Open .rrscenario in RoadRunner — see full city + traffic + behavior

Run it manually or via MATLAB script

Inspect the road damage, work zones, and agent behaviors

Use exported CSV + video for validation

(Advanced) Load CSV / OpenDRIVE into external simulators like CARLA / SUMO
